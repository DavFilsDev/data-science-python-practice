## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the exercises.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DavFilsDev/data-science-python-practice.git
cd data-science-python-practice
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

#### On **Linux / MacOS**:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### On **Windows**:

```bash
python -m venv venv

```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

Install all dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Run an Example File

Example with the first NumPy exercise:

```bash
python numpy/numpy_intro.py
```
